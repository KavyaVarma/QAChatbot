python 3 required
keras version 2.2.4 is required
in order to run the UI, flask version 0.12.2 is needed

Installation needed to run the UI(flask and jinja)
pip install -r requirements.txt

Also run "python -m spacy download en" with superuser privileges in order to use the anaphora resolution component

To use the UI:
Run "python app.py" in Terminal / Command Prompt, then open localhost:5000 in a Web browser

If the UI does not work , you could try the basic terminal version of the same. To do so :

You could provide custom input :
-write the context/paragraph into testing_doc.txt 
-and then run "python basic.py" and enter 1

Or you could test it on the existing test cases present in "tests.csv" :
run "python basic.py" and enter 0
